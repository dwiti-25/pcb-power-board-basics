# pcb-power-board-basics


This repository documents my learning journey in understanding
how power is delivered to electronic systems at the board level.

The goal of this project is to design a simple schematic and PCB
layout for a low-power power delivery board and explain the
electrical design choices involved.

## Project Scope
- Understand basic PCB concepts
- Create a simple power delivery schematic
- Design a basic PCB layout
- Document learning and design decisions

## Status
Day 1: Repository setup and system-level understanding
