# What is a PCB?

A Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is a physical platform that electrically
connects and mechanically supports electronic components using
conductive copper traces.

## Why PCBs are needed
- To replace messy wires
- To provide reliable power and signal paths
- To reduce noise and improve performance
- To enable mass manufacturing

## Basic PCB elements
- Components: resistors, capacitors, ICs
- Traces: copper paths that carry signals and power
- Ground plane: common reference for voltages
- Pads and vias: connection points

## Relation to semiconductor systems
Chips do not work in isolation. PCBs:
- Deliver power to chips
- Route signals between chips
- Affect performance through layout and noise
